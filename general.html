		Economic theory implies a negative correlation between educational attainment and most types of crime.
		First, schooling increases the returns from legitimate work (relative to most types of crime) and may also socialize youth.
		Second, youth who plan to engage frequently in crime benefit little from a good education.
		 Empirically, an increase in educational attainment significantly reduces subsequent violent and property crime yielding sizable social benefits.
		 Schooling has small positive effects on white-collar crime.
		 School attendance reduces contemporaneous property crime but increases contemporaneous violent crime among juveniles.
		 Incarceration during late adolescence appears to reduce educational attainment.

<p>    Since not all causally influential factors are covered by a theory, its implications cannot be expected to match the phenomena.
	The factors covered by the theory in the real world combine with others not included in the theory.
	 Therefore, its implications are true “hypothetically” only. As Cairnes writes, the conclusions of economics (but also of mechanics and astronomy)
